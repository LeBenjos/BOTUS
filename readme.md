# **BOTUS by LeBenjos**

## **WHAT IS BOTUS ?**
BOTUS is a discord bot that I developed during my first year of study at HETIC. The bot is coded in python. It is a personal project that I realized to apply my newly acquired knowledge in algorithms.  
The principle of the game is simple. Every day at 7 am a random word and chosen. You have 6 chances to find it. A ranking is available to know who is the best player!
